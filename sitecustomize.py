"""Inject full coverage for subprocess tests.

A subprocess is not run under the 'coverage' command, so we need to inject
a hook in the local python site to enable coverage.  If this directory is
in sys.path, this file will be imported, and the coverage code will run.
Since there might have already been a site-wide sitecustomize.py file,
we search for that file and force an import with importlib.reload.
