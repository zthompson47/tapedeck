    @pytest.mark.asyncio

        """Show the version number."""
        Runner = CliRunner()
        result = await runner.invoke(td, ['--version'])

Trying to test trio_click and having trouble getting error messages.
Needed to run the command by hand to get more info, but it was tough
because the CLI can run by hand successfully and still not pass this
test.  Looks like it's the pytest plugin - I have pytest-asyncio now,
which won't work, but this error doesn't tell me that.

So, install pytest-trio.  Now still doesn't work but different error
message from pytest-asyncio, so uninstaill pytest-asyncio to get things
working.  Hmm - confusing.

OK - remove "@pytest.mark.asyncio", then I can reinstall pytest-asyncio
and it works.

(~/g/tapedeck)$ python tapedeck/cli.py -v
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "tapedeck/cli.py", line 14, in <module>
    trio.run(td())

AttributeError: module 'anyio' has no attribute 'run'


I don't have anyio installed, but trio_click seems to use it.  After
installing anyio with pip, the error goes away.  0h - I uninstalled anyio
by hand and pip didn't complain: reinstalling trio_click fixes it.
